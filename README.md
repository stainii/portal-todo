A todo app? Yes, but a smart one.

## Inspired by "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"
This todo app is built around the principles of the famous 7 habits book, dividing tasks in 4 categories:

* Urgent, important             => Fires to extinguish
* Not urgent, important         => The tasks that help you the most
* Urgent, not important         => Tasks to be avoided in the future
* Not urgent, not important     => Tasks to never look at again

## Task templates
Also, some tasks always lead to other tasks. For example, when organizing an event, the preparations need a regular follow-up.

This app allows me to define task templates. When I add a task, that I often have to do, subtasks are automatically created and planned.
